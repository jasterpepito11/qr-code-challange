## My process
-First is to decide if I am going to use a CSS framework for styling. I decided to use tailwind css 
- Followed the style guide and worked for mobile-view first
- Checked and compared from the design images included
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling
- [Google Fonts - Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - for font-family
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned
Basic usage of grid and flex classes of tailwind when creating a responsive web application


### Continued development
 Planning to use tailwind for my future react projects to further enhance my knowledge

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me for easily styling my UI. I really like that it is not too opinionated with its design compared to other CSS frameworks.
